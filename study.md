## Required Readings

-   [Ruby-Doc.org: Variables](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/variables.html)
-   [Ruby-Doc.org: Instance Variables](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/instancevars.html)
-   [Ruby-Doc.org: Local Variables](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/localvars.html)

## Ruby Object Variables: Part I

Assume that we have the following class and an instance of it to work with.

```ruby
class Star
  def initialize(distance_ly, mass_solar)
    @distance_km = distance_ly * 9_460_730_472_580.8
    mass_kg = mass_solar * (1.99 * 10 ** 30)
  end

  def print_distance
    puts "The star is approximately #{@distance_km} kilometers away."
  end

  def print_mass
    puts "The star has a mass of approximately #{mass_kg} kilograms."
  end
end

proxima_centauri = Star.new(4.246, 0.123)
```

Does `proxima_centauri.print_distance` run? Why or why not? If so, then what is
the output? If not, then how can it be fixed?

```md
Yes, the output is:
The star is approximately 40170261586578.086 kilometers away.

It runs because print_distance is a defined method of the Star class. proxima_centauri
is a new instance of the Star class and has all associated methods. It uses the
distance_km property which is defined and passed when the class is initialized
```

## Ruby Object Variables: Part II

Does `proxima_centauri.print_mass` run? Why or why not? If so, then what is the
output? If not, then how can it be fixed?

```md
It does notr run because it requires the mass_kg variable which has not been
defined. To fix, change the initialize method to this:

def initialize(distance_ly, mass_solar)
  @distance_km = distance_ly * 9_460_730_472_580.8
  @mass_kg = mass_solar * (1.99 * 10 ** 30)
end
```

## Ruby Object Equality: Part I

Suppose that we have the following block of code.

```ruby
sol = Star.new(0, 1)
the_sun = Star.new(0, 1)
nearest_star = the_sun
```

Will modifying `sol` affect `the_sun`? Why or why not?

```md
No because the sol object and the_sun object reference two difference instances
of the Star class. They would both have different object_ids
```

## Ruby Object Equality: Part II

Will modifying `the_sun` affect `nearest_star`? Why or why not?

```md
I don't believe so. In JS, both would change - but in Ruby, they will have different
object IDs and I don't think that changes to the_sun will effect nearest_star
```

## JavaScript Objects

Create an object literal named `vega` with the following properties and values.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| distance | 25.04 |
| solarMass | 2.135 |

```javascript
const vega = {
  distance: 25.04,
  solarMass: 2.135
}
```

## Ruby vs. JavaScript

If, in the above code, `var`, `let`, or `const` were removed and the code were
executed as Ruby code, what type of object will be created?

```md
a hash?
```
